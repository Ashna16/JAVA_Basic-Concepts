Vector is similar to ArrayList class which implements the dynamic array.It implements the list interface.

-----------------------------------------  DIFFERENCE --------------------------------------------------
VECTOR LIST:

1. Implements dynamic Array.
2. All methods in vector list are Synchronized.
3. Vector doubles the size of Array, when its size is increased.
4. Slow Process


ARRAY LIST:
1. Implements dynamic Array.
2. All methods in Array list are not Synchronized.
3. Array List increases by half of the size of Array, when its size is increased.
4. Fast Process


---------------------------------------- METHODS OF VECTOR CLASS ------------------------------------------

void addElement(Object element): It inserts the element at the end of the Vector.

int capacity(): This method returns the current capacity of the vector.

int size(): It returns the current size of the vector.

void setSize(int size): It changes the existing size with the specified size.

boolean contains(Object element): This method checks whether the specified element is present in the Vector. 
If the element is been found it returns true else false.

boolean containsAll(Collection c): It returns true if all the elements of collection c are present in the Vector.

Object elementAt(int index): It returns the element present at the specified location in Vector.

Object firstElement(): It is used for getting the first element of the vector.

Object lastElement(): Returns the last element of the array.

Object get(int index): Returns the element at the specified index.

boolean isEmpty(): This method returns true if Vector doesnâ€™t have any element.

boolean removeElement(Object element): Removes the specifed element from vector.

boolean removeAll(Collection c): It Removes all those elements from vector which are present in the Collection c.

void setElementAt(Object element, int index): It updates the element of specifed index with the given element.
