Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of 
their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

To achieve encapsulation in Java âˆ’

Declare the variables of a class as private.
Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

Important note- 
1. Always use set keyword,before function name
2. Always return using get keyword
3.Also,when you make a variable private,it is for a particular class only.
