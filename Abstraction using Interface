An interface is a 100% abstract class. 
It can only have static, final, and public fields and abstract methods. 
It’s frequently referred to as a blueprint of a class as well. 
Java interfaces allow you to implement multiple inheritances in your code, as a class can implement any number of interfaces. 
Classes can access an interface with the implements keyword.

In the example, we define two interfaces: 
Animal with two abstract methods (interface methods are abstract by default) and 
Bird with two static fields and an abstract method.


interface  Animal  {
public  void  eat();
public  void  sound();
}
interface  Bird  {
int numberOfLegs = 2;
String outerCovering =  "feather";
public  void  fly();
}
class  Eagle  implements Animal, Bird {
public  void  eat()  {
System.out.println("Eats reptiles and amphibians.");
}
public  void  sound()  {
System.out.println("Has a high-pitched whistling sound.");
}
public  void  fly()  {
System.out.println("Flies up to 10,000 feet.");
}
}
class  TestEagleInterfaces  {
public  static  void  main(String[] args)  {
Eagle myEagle =  new Eagle();

myEagle.eat();
myEagle.sound();
myEagle.fly();

System.out.println("Number of legs: "  + Bird.numberOfLegs);
System.out.println("Outer covering: "  + Bird.outerCovering);
}
}
