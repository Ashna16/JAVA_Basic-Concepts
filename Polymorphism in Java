Polymorphism makes it possible to use the same code structure in different forms. 
In Java, this means that you can declare several methods with the same name as long as they are different in certain characteristics.

Static polymorphism (method overloading)

Method overloading means that you can have several methods with the same name within a class.
However, the number, names, or types of their parameters need to be different.

Dynamic polymorphism (method overriding)

Using the method overriding feature of Java, you can override the methods of a parent class from its child class.
