A constructor is called at the time of object creation.
Constructor name should be same as class name.
Constructor is called in public area only.
Constructor has no return type.
Constructor may or may not be overloaded.

There are two types of constructors in Java:

Default constructor (no-arg constructor).
Parameterized constructor.

Constructor Overloading: Constructor overloading in Java is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists. 
They are arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task. 
They are differentiated by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and their types.
