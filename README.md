# JAVA_Basic-Concepts
Java is an Object oriented Programming Language (OOP) 

OOP concepts of Java revolve around- ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, POLYMORPHISM AND INHERITENCE. 

OBJECT- Is an instance of Java class, it contains both the data and the function which operates on the data.

CLASS- Is a group of similar entities (objects with similar properties). 

ABSTRACTION- Is the process of showing only necessary details and hiding other details.

ENCAPSULATION- It is the process of bundling the fields and data into one class, It prevents outer classes from accessing and changing fields and methods of a class.

POLYMORPHISM-Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.It inlcudes Method Overriding and Method Overloading. 

INHERITANCE- Here,one object acquires the properties and behaviour of the parent object. It is used for code re-usability.

class Program

{

  
   public static void main ( String[] args)
        
   {
          
   System.out.print ("HELLO");
         
   }
         
}
