Access control is a mechanism, an attribute of encapsulation which restricts the access of certain members of a class to 
specific parts of a program. Access to members of a class can be controlled using the access modifiers.
There are four access modifiers in Java. 
They are:

public
protected
default
private
 

If the member (variable or method) is not marked as either public or protected or private, 
the access modifier for that member will be default. We can apply access modifiers to classes also.

Among the four access modifiers, private is the most restrictive access modifier and public is the least restrictive access modifier.
Syntax for declaring a access modifier is shown below:

access-modifier  data-type  variable-name;
